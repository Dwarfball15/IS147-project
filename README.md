### Goal
Our goal is to create an application that helps users track their workouts with caloric intake within an intuitive ui and have a dashboard that easily shows users' progress over time. This problem stems from a lack of good public applications that provide an intuitive way to track progress in the gym or elsewhere. Usually, apps are clunky or locked behind a pay wall with unnecessary features that the user may not want. Most of the time, the user will turn back to pencil and paper, which is inconvenient and hard to calculate progress.
